== Customizing requests and responses

There may be situations where you do not want to document a request exactly as it was sent
or a response exactly as it was received. Spring REST Docs <<Preprocessors, provides a
number of preprocessors>> that can be used to modify a request or response before it's
documented.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessing-one-test]]
=== Preprocessing requests and responses in a single test

Preprocessing is configured by calling `document` with an `OperationRequestPreprocessor`,
and/or an `OperationResponsePreprocessor`. Instances can be obtained using the
static `preprocessRequest` and `preprocessResponse` methods on `Preprocessors`. For
example:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/PerTestPreprocessing.java[tags=preprocessing]
----
<1> Apply a request preprocessor that will remove the header named `Foo`.
<2> Apply a response preprocessor that will pretty print its content.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessing-every-test]]
=== Preprocessing requests and responses in every test

Alternatively, you may want to apply the same preprocessors to every test. You can do
so by configuring the preprocessors in your `@Before` method and using the
<<documentating-your-api-parameterized-output-directories, support for parameterized
output directories>>. The exact approach varies a little depending on whether you are
using MockMvc or REST Assured.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessing-every-test-mockmvc]]
==== Preprocessing in every test using MockMvc

First, perform the setup in your `@Before` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create the `RestDocumentationResultHandler`, configured to preprocess the request
	and response.
<2> Use `alwaysDo` when creating the `MockMvc` instance so that it configured to always
	call the documentation result handler.

In each test, the `RestDocumentationResultHandler`  can be configured with anything
test-specific before the call to the service is made:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/mockmvc/EveryTestPreprocessing.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Document the links specific to the resource that is being tested
<2> The `perform` call will automatically produce the documentation snippets due to the
	use of `alwaysDo` above.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessing-every-test-rest-assured]]
==== Preprocessing in every test using REST Assured

First, perform the setup in your `@Before` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/PreprocessingEveryTest.java[tags=setup]
----
<1> Create the `RestDocumentationFilter`, configured to preprocess the request
	and response.
<2> Use `addFilter` when creating the `RequestSpecification` instance, so that it is
	configured to always call the documentation filter.

In each test, the `RestDocumentationFilter` can be configured with anything
test-specific before the call to the service is made:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{examples-dir}/com/example/restassured/PreprocessingEveryTest.java[tags=use]
----
<1> Create the `RestDocumentationFilter`, configured to preprocess the request
	and response.
<2> Create the `RequestSpecification` instance, configured to always call the
	documentation result handler.

=== Preprocessors



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-pretty-print]]
==== Pretty printing

`prettyPrint` on `Preprocessors` formats the content of the request or response
to make it easier to read.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-mask-links]]
==== Masking links

If you're documenting a Hypermedia-based API, you may want to encourage clients to
navigate the API using links rather than through the use of hard coded URIs. One way to do
this is to limit the use of URIs in the documentation. `maskLinks` on
`Preprocessors` replaces the `href` of any links in the response with `...`. A
different replacement can also be specified if you wish.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-remove-headers]]
==== Removing headers

`removeHeaders` on `Preprocessors` removes any occurrences of the named headers
from the request or response.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-replace-patterns]]
==== Replacing patterns

`replacePattern` on `Preprocessors` provides a general purpose mechanism for
replacing content in a request or response. Any occurrences of a regular expression are
replaced.



[[customizing-requests-and-responses-preprocessors-writing-your-own]]
==== Writing your own preprocessor

If one of the built-in preprocessors does not meet your needs, you can write your own by
implementing the `OperationPreprocessor` interface. You can then use your custom
preprocessor in exactly the same way as any of the built-in preprocessors.

If you only want to modify the content (body) of a request or response, consider
implementing the `ContentModifier` interface and using it with the built-in
`ContentModifyingOperationPreprocessor`.
